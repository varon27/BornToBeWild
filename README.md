# BornToBeWild

This website is a Wild Code School Project : create the website of the rock-music group "BORN TO BE WILD".

A group of 4 Wild Code School's students created this website.
It is composed by the following parts:

- Home Page : header, iframe video, newsletter subscription, twitter feed, agenda quick pic, news extract
- About us : a bit more on the group story
- News : examples of news related to the group
- Media : sum up of imaginative still and moving images material
- Contact : contact form built with Bootstrap 3.4 features

-> Footer is the same on all pages and contains backlinks to navbar tabs, fake links to legal mentions section and social networks.
-> The Website is fully responsive and built following a "mobile-first" principle.

This project was our first website after only 2 weeks of html/css practice.
Thus it might not be perfect... please be kind with beginners' work :)
